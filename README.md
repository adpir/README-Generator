## Description : 
The goal of this project is to create a high quality **README Generator app**. On this professional **README**, the user will know how to *use* the app, *install it*, *report* any issues and *contribute*. My motivation for buiding this app was to create an app using new programming skills such as node.js, using an inline characters such as ```backtick```, functions, prompts and responses.

### Installation:

To make a command-line application that dynamically generate a professional **README** file, the user need to install the ```npm``` know as (**Node Package Manager**) from the user's input using the ```inquirer package```. Here is some guidelines on how to create a README Generator: Create a ```.gitignore file``` and ```.DS_Store``` so that your ```node_modules``` directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Rememeber to create a ```.gitignore file``` before installing any ```npm``` dependencies. Make sure that your repo includes a ```package.json```. Create one by running ```npm init``` when you first set up the project.
