## Description : 
The goal of this project is to create a high-quality **README Generator App**. On this professional **README**, the user will know how to *use* the app, *install* it, *report* any issues and *contribute*. My motivation for building this generate app was to create an app using new programming skill such as node.js, using an inline character such as ```backtick```, functions, prompt and responses.

### Installation:

To make a command-line application that dynamically generate a professional **README** file the user need to install the ```npm``` know as **Node Package Manager**) from a user's input using the ```inquire package```. Here is are some guidelines on how to create a README Generator. Create a ```.gitignore file``` and ```.DS_Store``` so that your ```node_modules``` directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Remember to create a ```.gitignore file``` before installing any ```npm``` dependencies. Make sure that your repo includes a ```package.json```. Create one by running ```npm init``` when you first set upthe project.
