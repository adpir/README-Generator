## Installation
To make a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README file, the user needs to install the NPM know as (Node Package Manager) from a user's input tusing the Inquirer package. Here is are some guidelines on how to create a README generator. Create a .gitignore file and include node_modules/ and .DS_Store/ so that your node_modules directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub.Remember to create a .gitignore file before installing any npm dependencies. Make sure that your repo includes a package.json with the required dependencies. Create one by running npm init when you first set up the project before instlling any dependencies.

## Test
npm install
