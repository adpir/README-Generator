## Description : 
The goal of this project is to create a high-quality **README Generator App**. On this professional **README**, the user will know how to *use* the app, *install* it, *report* any issues and *contribute*. My motivation for building this generate app was to create an app using new programming skills such as node.js, using an inline character such as ``` backtick```, functions, prompts and responses.

### Installation:

To make a command-line application that dynamically generate a professional **README** file, the user need to install the ```npm``` know as (**Node Package Manager**) from the user's input using the ``` inquirer package```. Here is are some guidelines on how to create a README Generator: Create a ```.gitignore file``` and ```.DS_Store``` so that your ```node_modules``` directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Remember to create a ```.gitignore file``` before installing any ```npm``` dependencies. Make sure that your repo includes a ```package.json```. Create one by running ```npm init``` when you first set up the project.


### Contributing:

Yes, Pull request are welcome. For any major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. Please make sure to update test as appropriate.


### Test:
