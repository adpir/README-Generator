### Description : 
***
The goal of this project is to create a high-quality README Generator app. On this professional README, the user will know how to use the app, install it, report any issues and contribute. My motivation for building this generate app was to create an app using new programming as node.js, using inline characters such as backtick, functions, prompt and responses.

## Installation:
***
To make a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README file, the user needs to install the NPM know as ( Node Package manager) from the user's input using the inquirer package. here are some guidelines on how to create a README generator. Create a .gitignore file and include ```node_modules``` and /DS_Store so that your node_modules directory isn't tracked or unploaded to Github. Remember to create a .gitignore file before installing any npm dependencies/ Make sure that your repo includes a package.json with the require dependencies. cCreate one by running npm initwhen you first set up the project before installling any dependencies.
