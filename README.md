### Description : 
The goal of this project is to create a high quality README Generator app. On this professional README, the user will know how to use the app, install it, report any issues, and contribute. My motivation for building this generate app was to create an app using new programming as node.js, using an inline character such as backtick, functions, prompt, and responses.

## Installation
To make a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README file, the user needs to install the NPM know as (Node Package Manager) from a user's input tusing the Inquirer package. Here is are some guidelines on how to create a README generator. Create a .gitignore file and include node_modules/ and .DS_Store/ so that your node_modules directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub.Remember to create a .gitignore file before installing any npm dependencies. Make sure that your repo includes a package.json with the required dependencies. Create one by running npm init when you first set up the project before installing any dependencies.
