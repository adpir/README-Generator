`## Description:

The goal of this project is to create a High Quality ReadMe Generator. Using the command-line application we need to  dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

Please read carefully the instructions on how this app functions below. I will explain in detait how we should run app, how to used it and how to install it by providing videos and screenshoots.
and   

To get started, Please do the following:

Create a .gitignore file and include node_modules/ and .DS_Store/ so that your node_modules directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your .gitignore file before installing any npm dependencies.
Make sure that your repo includes a package.json with the required dependencies. You can create one by running npm init when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies.
In order to run this application you will need to do the following using your command-line:
node index.js



### Installation:

The installation I used to make sure the development environment is running efficiently. I make sure to install this program below:

* Terminal (Command Line)
* Bash
* Visual Studio Code
* Git Lab
* NPM Inquirer/node_modules
* Package.JSON/package_lock.JSON
* GitIgnore



### Usage:
This page could be used as a starting place for making a ReadMe Generator.



### Contributing:
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes,<br>
please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.<br>
Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
